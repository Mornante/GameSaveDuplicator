# Welcome

This is Yet another University Project :)

Yes the code in this repository is awful and the project does not provide much value

**BUT**

I love to keep these types of project around to remind myself where I started in my early days of learning to code and how I have grown as a developer since. They inspire me to become even better in the future and allow me to look back at these old types of projects and say **why did I not just do this instead**.

I hope you enjoy reviewing this codebase, finding bugs, duplicate code and all round bad practices as I have enjoyed building this project back in the day.

# GameSaveDuplicator

A simple Winforms Forms Application that allows you to copy files from multiple folder locations into a single location, more specifically **Video Game Save Files** (sort of how steam backup works)

Back in the day while playing games without using a platform that would automatically backup my save files, I had to manually copy game save files from the C: drive to my portable drive and wanted to create a way to streamline this process without needing to go to every game I had installed in different folders to copy the save file.

Now with this simple app I can specify where all my current games are saving their save files too and when ready I can just click the Backup button and it will duplicate those save files for me to a folder / external hard drive of my choice.
