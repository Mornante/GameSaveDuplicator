# Game Save Duplicator

Thank you for visiting :)

# Project Overview

This WinForms application is designed to streamline the process of backing up video game save files from multiple folder locations into a single destination. Inspired by my own experiences of manually copying save files from the C: drive to a portable drive, the application simplifies this task, especially for gamers using platforms without automated backup features.

Users can specify the various directories where their games save files are located, eliminating the need to navigate through each game’s installation folder. Once the folders are set, users can effortlessly initiate the backup process by clicking a single “Backup” button. The application will then duplicate the selected save files into a designated folder or external hard drive of their choice.

This tool not only saves time but also ensures that gamers can easily secure their progress without the hassle of manually managing each file. Its user-friendly interface and straightforward functionality make it an essential utility for any gamer looking to protect their save data efficiently.

# What to Expect

Projects like this was an integral part of my learnings in software development in general. This repository captures an important phase in my journey as a software developer. So you can expect the following:

### Code Quality:
The code here is a testament to my early programming skills. You may encounter numerous bugs, terrible inefficiencies, and less-than-ideal coding practices that were part of my learning curve.

### Learning Journey:
This project was more about the journey than the destination. It helped me understand the basics of software development and laid the foundation for the skills I have today.

### Nostalgia:
While this project may no longer be relevant, it’s a personal reminder of where I began. It’s a piece of my history that I keep as a benchmark of my progress as a software developer.

# Why This Project is Archived
This project is in an archived state and is no longer being actively maintained or updated. I’ve chosen to preserve it in its original form as a record of my growth as a developer. It’s a snapshot of a time when I was still finding my footing in the world of coding.

# Final Thoughts
I hope you find value in exploring this codebase, even if it’s just to see how far one can come from humble beginnings. And if you don't find value in this project I hope it brings a smile to your face as you find many.... many.... cringe worthy practices.

This project may be frozen in time, but the lessons I learned from it continue to influence my work today.
